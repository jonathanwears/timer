# Timer created by React

## Project Description
##### This project is created by react. It was originally created to help me stretch with a rest period to reposition. 
##### This project is a simple timer using **useEffect** and **useReducer** hook.  This project allows a user to set a 'rest' timer and a 'stretch' timer. The app will automatically switch between the two timers.  

##### The above features can be found in: <br>  [/src/components/Counter](../src/components/Counter) <br> [/src/components/TimerUi](../src/components/TimerUi) <br>
## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ cd ../Timer
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
## Technology used
##### React, Create React App
## Notes
##### The project continues to be improved over time. <br> This project has a secondary type of timer which is not yet implemented.
